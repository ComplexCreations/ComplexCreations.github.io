    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>A key structure  that could be in the real mystery black box are the tubes as they are used to transfer water. 
</p>
    <h1>Evidence </h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box that randomly distributes water. Regardless of the amount of water you put in .If you were to put 250 ML of water it may or may not come out. My model's structures were tubes and big cups to transfer and hold water. I tested my model by putting water on the top tube. To sum things up The mystery black box is a box that randomly reveals water. </p>
    <h1>Reasoning </h1>
    <p>A model of something is a prototype or rough draft used to get an idea of the final product.
They can be useful for creating products like a laptop. One of the advantages of a model is being able to detect problems before they become big . 
 </p>
    <h1>Reasoning Pt2</h1>
    <p>I think that tubes are a key structure because there are the main components that allow water to transfer to other places. The tubes are the very reason why water comes out from the bottom. When me and my group tested our model it was clear that the tubes were doing all the work and it is exactly why the tubes are a key structure.
